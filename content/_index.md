A well-equipped, spirited cruiser — a joy to sail in light airs and fresh winds alike. A great choice for small crew cruising, provided you have some sailing experience under your belt. The boat is responsive and at her best in the hands of an attentive crew.

This is the enhanced Albin Express "Jubilee" celebration model from 1990. Unlike most Expresses, she features a fixed galley, water tank with sink and tap, as well as LPG and shore power systems. For cruising comfort, there's also a proper compressor cool box, a chemical toilet, and a cabin heater.

The outboard is a reliable 8 hp Yamaha with a large-diameter propeller — she turns nicely even in tight harbours.

Lines, anchor, and rock wedges are naturally included.
