## Yamaha 8 hp

### Starting Procedure

1. Open the air valve on the fuel tank, pump the fuel line 10 times
2. Turn the throttle to the marked position, open the choke, and pull start (watch out for the boom)
3. Once the engine starts, close the choke and reduce throttle
4. To stop: press the red button for a couple of seconds. It shouldn't require force. If nothing happens, try gently flicking the button upward.

### Tips

- If the engine won't start or keeps stalling, try holding/pulling the shutdown button outward and flicking it upward
- Always check that the fuel line is properly connected to the engine before any dock operations. The connector can sometimes come loose unnoticed when raising or turning the motor.
- The outboard is not locked on its swivel axis, so you can steer with it during low-speed manoeuvring in the harbour. When heading out, make sure the engine is at the right angle so the boat tracks straight with the tiller centred.

### Fuel

The fuel tank and a reserve canister are in the rear locker. The reserve canister contains 98-octane petrol with 0% oil.

**Important:** When refuelling, it is essential to add 1–2% motor oil to the petrol or the engine will be damaged. Add the correct amount of oil directly to the fuel tank.

### Under Sail

When sailing, raise the bracket to the upper position and tilt the engine out of the water. The tilt mechanism is somewhat stiff. Remember to push the lock pin in after tilting the engine.
