## Deck Equipment

Attached to the stern rail:
- Rescue ring
- Rescue ring light
- Drogue anchor
- Heaving line

## Stored Equipment

- **Flares, rockets, horn, and wooden plugs** — starboard shelf
- **Bolt cutters** — starboard lower compartment
- **Day shapes** (anchor ball and motoring cone) — rear locker shelf
- **First aid kit and fire blanket** — port shelf
- **Fire extinguisher** — port side on the quarter berth wall. A second one (uncertified) is behind the galley stove near the gas valve.

## Through-Hulls

There are three through-hull fittings:
- Two at the bottom of the rear locker
- One on the starboard side, just aft of the forepeak access

It's good practice to check the rear through-hulls for leaks whenever you're rummaging in the aft locker.
