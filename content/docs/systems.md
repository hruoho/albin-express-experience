## Electrical

Battery power is switched on from the main switch, located below the companionway hatch, next to the toilet. The control panel on the port side controls navigation lights and cabin lights. The panel labels are partly misleading. The instrument panel switch is on the starboard side in the galley cabinet.

### Shore Power

The boat has a shore power system and two 80 Ah batteries (replaced 2025). Charging starts when shore power is connected. The outlets behind the main switch can be used when on shore power.

## Gas

Unlike standard Albin Express boats, this one has a fixed gas system. A 2 kg gas bottle is in a dedicated compartment at the stern.

There are two gas valves: one at the bottle connection and another just before the stove, on the side of the galley. Both must be open when cooking, and it is safest to keep both closed at all other times.

**Critical safety note:** Always make sure the gas bottle valve is closed when the stove is not in use. Leaving the valve open is a life-threatening hazard, as the system's integrity cannot be guaranteed.

A good practice is to leave the gas bottle compartment lid open while cooking, so the bottle stays visible and you won't forget to close the valve.

## Water

The boat has a 40-litre water tank, a tap, and a small sink that drains directly to the sea. Bring your own drinking water — the tank water can taste stale and its purity cannot be guaranteed.

The water fill access is on the foredeck. No tools needed to open it.

## Toilet

The boat has a Dometic 976 chemical toilet (user manual available online). The tank can be emptied most easily into the home port portable toilet or a shore-side toilet at another harbour. Good practice is to rinse the tank with clean water after emptying and refill the flush water tank.

## Refrigerator

The fridge/cool box is a Dometic CoolFreeze 36 (user manual available online). Temperature can be adjusted between -18°C and +10°C. Power supply is easily disrupted when the power cable moves — check occasionally that the fridge is still running.
