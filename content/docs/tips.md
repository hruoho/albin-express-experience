## Tiller Lock

The tiller can be locked at centre by raising it to the upper position. The lock line can be easily detached to improve access to the rear hatch.

## Mainsail Battens

The mainsail battens are held in the mast track by an orange silicone strap. The strap must be removed when reefing and put back when the reef is shaken out or the sail is lowered (otherwise the battens will escape from the mast track).

## Mosquito Nets and Rain Cover

The boat has mosquito nets for the companionway and forehatch — use them at night when ventilation is wanted.

The white cover used at the home berth can also be used as rain protection over the companionway by hanging one edge from the boom.

## Overnight Storage

The boat has two large canoe-style bags that fit in the cockpit locker overnight, even in rain. Handy for packing sailing clothes, life jackets, and other items you don't need below while sleeping.

## Noise in the Harbour

In port, attach halyards to the hull rather than the mast to prevent them from clanging in the wind and keeping everyone awake. A tight vang also causes some vibration in wind — you can lower the boom overnight to reduce the humming.
