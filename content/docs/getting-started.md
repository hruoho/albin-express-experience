## Home Port

The boat is moored at Koivusaari Sailing Club on the middle dock, slip number 115, between boats Anna and Sydney.

The marina has parking and a WC (white portable toilet near the mast crane), but few other facilities.

The dock gate is kept locked at all times — you need a key in both directions.

## Mooring Lines

Two crossing stern lines are used at the home berth: an anchor line is attached on the port side and a blue synthetic rope on the starboard side.

When departing, the blue dock line is detached from the boat and tied to the dock. The blue line is not removed from the buoy — it stays in place waiting for the boat to return.

A loop is tied to the middle of the blue line, making it easy to attach to the aft cleat at the right tension.

The bow lines and anchor line have home port settings pre-marked with white thread (aligned with the hull).

## Handy Dock Buoy Hook

The anchor line has a Handy Dock hook attached. If you're not familiar with it, get acquainted before departure so you can release the boat from the buoy smoothly.

The grab is pulled away from the hook while the hook is attached to the buoy. The grab stays on the boat and works as a regular boat hook. When departing, the Handy Dock hook is released by pulling the "trigger" (the hole in the centre of the mechanism) with either the boat hook or your finger if you can reach it.

When using the anchor, detach the Handy Dock from the steel carabiner and connect the anchor line directly to the chain.
