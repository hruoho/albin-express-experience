I've been around boats my whole life — my first sail was at three weeks old. After years of crewing on family boats, I got my first sailboat, an H-boat, and have been hooked ever since. The Albin Express has been mine for several years now, and it's a perfect match: fast, responsive, and simple enough to sail and maintain single-handedly.

I work in tech, but spend every free moment outdoors — sailing, hiking, chasing sunrises and sunsets. My home waters are the Helsinki and Espoo archipelago, with longer cruises out to the Archipelago Sea.

The evening sails are my way of sharing what makes sailing so good. Whether you want to learn the basics — trim a sail, take the tiller — or just sit back and enjoy the ride, I'll adapt to the group. No experience needed, just bring a warm layer.
