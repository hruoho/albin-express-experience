summary: "A calm evening glide along the Porkkala shoreline. Near flat water."
---

A textbook evening sail. Left the marina around 1800 with a gentle southerly barely wrinkling the surface. Full main and genoa up, gliding at 3–4 knots toward Porkkalanniemi.

The water was almost flat — just enough breeze to keep the sails drawing. Guests took turns at the tiller, practiced a few tacks, and asked good questions about sail trim. One of those evenings where you remember why you do this.

Rounded the point as the sun dropped low, golden light on the cliffs. Back at the marina by 2100, everyone reluctant to step ashore.
