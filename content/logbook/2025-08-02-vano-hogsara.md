summary: "Downwind run in 13 m/s with big following seas. A proper ride."
---

Left Vänö after lunch with the wind already building from the southwest. By the time we cleared the shelter of the island, it was a solid 13 m/s with gusts above that.

Set the genoa only and let her run. The waves were large and rolling — the kind that lift the stern and send you surfing down the face. The Express loves this. She stayed balanced on the tiller with minimal correction, boat speed touching 7 knots on the surfs.

The approach to Högsåra required some concentration — big seas in the narrows — but she handled it well. Tied up at the guest harbour with shaky legs and wide grins.

## Conditions

- Wind: SW 13–15 m/s, gusting 17
